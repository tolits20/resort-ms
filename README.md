üîπ Concept & Flow
Admin Assigns Tasks

The admin can assign specific tasks to staff (e.g., room cleaning, maintenance, guest assistance).
Tasks should have details like title, description, deadline, priority, and status.
Tasks are stored in the database and linked to staff members.
Staff Views Assigned Tasks

Staff can log in and view their assigned tasks.
Tasks should be categorized as Pending, In Progress, or Completed for better tracking.
Task Notifications

Staff receive notifications when:
A new task is assigned.
A task is approaching its deadline.
A task status is updated (e.g., marked as completed by admin).
Staff Updates Task Status

Staff should be able to mark tasks as In Progress or Completed once they finish them.
The admin can review completed tasks and approve them if needed.
